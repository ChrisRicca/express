      %h2 Installation
      
      %p
        Express and all of it's dependencies can be installed from
        %a{ :href => 'http://github.com/visionmedia/express' } Github
        by executing the following commands:
      
      %pre
        %code $ git clone git://github.com/visionmedia/express.git
      
      %pre
        %code $ cd express && git submodule update --init
      
      %p
        Alternatively the
        %a{ :href => 'http://github.com/visionmedia/kiwi' } Kiwi
        package management system for nodejs can be installed, and
        you may then install Express with the following command:
      
      %pre
        %code $ kiwi -v install express
        
      %h2 Routing
      
      %p
        The first thing we need to do is create a new file,
        which in this example I will name
        %em app.js
        \. The contents of 
        %em app.js
        should look similar to below, where we have
        "unshifted" the path to where we had previously
        installed Express, so that node can find it.
        
      %pre
        %code= snippit 'intro.js'
        
      %p
        Developers using
        %em Kiwi
        will need to use a slightly different approach shown
        below. Kiwi require libraries that have been installed,
        and even supports version resolution (left out in this example).
        
      %pre
        %code= snippit 'intro.kiwi.js'
        
      %h2 Views
      
      %p
        The first thing we need to do is
        tell Express what our application root is by
        using the 
        %em set()
        function. In this case the directly in
        which this file is executed, happens to be
        our application root, this is
        %em __dirname
        \.
        
      %p
        In order to render our view, we must understand
        that routes are evaulated in context to the request
        being served, so
        %em this
        references the current
        %em Request
        instance. We then call
        %em Request#render()
        with the name of our view, and pass
        any options that we wish.
        
      %pre
        %code= snippit 'intro.views.js'
        
      %p
        Click for more information on 
        %a{ :href => 'plugins.views.html' } Views
        
      %h2 Running An Application
      
      %p To run our application simply pass node the path to your javascript app:
      
      %pre
        %code $ node app.js
